# 🐚 Bash / Shell Scripting - Master Notes
# ===========================================

# ➡️ What is Shell Scripting?
# - 📜 Shell script = list of commands executed by the shell.
# - 🛠️ Helps automate daily tasks, simplify workflows, and save time.

# ➡️ Why Learn Shell Scripting?
# - ⚡ Automation of system tasks.
# - 🎯 Reduces manual errors.
# - 📦 Integrates easily with Linux tools.
# - 🔄 Essential for DevOps, Cloud, and SysAdmin work.

# ===========================================
# 🏗️ Structure of a Shell Script
# ===========================================

# - #!/bin/bash -> Shebang to tell system to use Bash shell
# - # (hash) used for comments
# - Commands written line by line

# ===========================================
# 🧠 Important Concepts
# ===========================================

# ➡️ Variables
# - 🧩 Used to store values like strings, numbers, paths.
# - Accessed using "$" symbol.

# ➡️ Conditional Statements
# - 🧠 if-else structure used for decision making.
# - case statement used for multi-conditions.

# ➡️ Loops
# - 🔄 for loop: Repeat a set of commands for each item.
# - 🔁 while loop: Keep repeating until a condition fails.
# - ⬅️ until loop: Keep running until a condition becomes true.

# ➡️ Functions
# - 🧩 Group multiple commands into a reusable block.
# - 🛠️ Helps in modular scripting and reduces repetition.

# ➡️ User Input
# - 📝 Allows interaction with users by accepting inputs.

# ➡️ Command Line Arguments
# - 📥 Pass values to the script at runtime.
# - Helps in making scripts dynamic and flexible.

# ➡️ File and Directory Checks
# - 📂 Scripts can test if a file or directory exists.
# - 🔐 Can check permissions, ownership, and type.

# ➡️ Exit Status
# - 🛑 After every command, an exit status is generated.
# - 0 = Success, Non-zero = Failure/Error.

# ===========================================
# ⚙️ Execution Flow
# ===========================================

# 1️⃣ Script starts executing line by line from the top.
# 2️⃣ Variables are read and assigned.
# 3️⃣ Conditionals and loops are evaluated.
# 4️⃣ Functions are called where necessary.
# 5️⃣ Script exits with an exit code.

# ===========================================
# 📚 Best Practices
# ===========================================

# - ✅ Always use clear and meaningful variable names.
# - ✅ Add comments generously to explain logic.
# - ✅ Handle errors properly.
# - ✅ Make scripts executable only when necessary.
# - ✅ Use functions to modularize complex scripts.

# ===========================================
# 🚀 Conclusion
# ===========================================

# - Bash scripting is an essential skill for Linux/Cloud engineers.
# - Mastering it opens doors to automation, cloud-native DevOps, and system engineering.
# - Next, we'll dive deep into real-world commands, scripts, and projects!
