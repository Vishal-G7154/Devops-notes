🐍 Introduction to Python
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language designed to be easy to read and write. It’s known for its simplicity and versatility. Python can be used for various types of programming, such as:

Web Development 🌐
Data Science 📊
Machine Learning 🤖
Automation 🤖
Scripting 📝

💻 Classes and Objects



🧳 Classes
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and behaviors that the objects created from the class will have.

Syntax:

python
Copy
Edit
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hello, {self.name}!")




🧱 Objects
An object is an instance of a class. You create an object by calling the class as if it were a function.

Syntax:

obj = MyClass("Vishal")
obj.greet()  # Output: Hello, Vishal!
Key Concepts:
Constructor (__init__): Used to initialize an object’s state (attributes).

Instance Variables: Attributes that belong to an object.

Methods: Functions defined within a class that define behaviors.

Inheritance: Allows one class to inherit attributes and methods from another.

Encapsulation: Hiding private data from outside access.

Polymorphism: Ability to use methods in different ways.




***************************************************************************

🧩 Modules and Packages

📦 Modules
A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements (e.g., functions, classes).

Syntax:

# mymodule.py
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
You can import a module into your program:

import mymodule
mymodule.greet("Vishal")  # Output: Hello, Vishal!


📦 Packages
A package is a collection of modules in a directory.

Example folder structure:

mypackage/
    __init__.py
    module1.py
    module2.py


from mypackage import module1

Key Points:
Importing: You can import functions, classes, and variables from modules or packages.
Standard Library: Python comes with a rich set of built-in modules (e.g., math, datetime).


*********************************************************
⚙️ Functions and Methods

📝 Functions
A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task.

Syntax:

def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
You call the function by using its name:


greet("Vishal")  # Output: Hello, Vishal!


🛠️ Methods
A method is a function that belongs to an object (an instance of a class).

Syntax (inside a class):

class MyClass:
    def greet(self, name):


        print(f"Hello, {name}!")


You call a method on an object:
obj = MyClass()
obj.greet("Vishal")  # Output: Hello, Vishal!



Key Points:
Arguments and Return Values: Functions can take arguments and return values.
Lambda Functions: Short, anonymous functions created using lambda.
Recursion: A function that calls itself.
Variable Scope: The region in the program where a variable can be accessed.

📚 Python Libraries (To Be Written Separately)
Libraries are collections of pre-written code that allow you to perform specific tasks more efficiently. Python's standard library provides modules for regular expressions, file I/O, web scraping, data manipulation, and much more.

We will have a separate file to discuss and list popular libraries such as:
NumPy 📊 for data science
Pandas 📈 for data analysis
Flask 🌐 for web development
TensorFlow 🧠 for machine learning


📚 Conclusion
With Python, you can easily:
Create objects with classes.
Organize your code with modules and packages.
Write functions to break down tasks and methods to operate on objects.
